# Mildew Detector in Cherry Leaves

The Mildew Detector is an application that can predict whether a an individual cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew. 

The app is built around a supervised ML model that performs binary classification with single-label predictions.

## Dataset Content

* The image dataset is a dataset retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). For this project, a hypothetical user story was applied to utilise predictive analysis to business criterias that could be implemented in a real case scenario. 

* The dataset consists of over 4000 images taken of healthy and mildew infested cherry leaves, collected from the company Farmy & Foods' cherry crops. Cherry tress can be infected with the fungus Podosphaera clandestina, resulting in powdery mildew on the leaves. To check the trees manually for mildew is a tedious, time-consuming process for employees. The application was designed to streamline the process. When mildew is being detected in an individual of the crops, a compound can be applied to kill the fungus.
